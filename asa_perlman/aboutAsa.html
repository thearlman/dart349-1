      <h1>About Asa Perlman</h1><br>

      <p>Interdisciplinary designer, Asa has people on his mind: thinking about why/how they
        are fighting with, loving, wanting, and/or needing things.</p><br>
      <p>His speculative approach to
        making stems from a fascination with the way we orient ourselves, or rather are oriented
        by, all of the things we make, buy, interact with, and destroy, and all of those we
        donâ€™t.</p><br>
        <p>For him, this fascination reaches its boiling point around objects and systems
        which straddle lines between Art, Technology, and Design. Infatuated in equal measures
        by Amazon, the Bauhaus, Creationism, and Darwin, he thinks objects can be found at the
        heart of consumer, cultural, spiritual, and scientific belief and practice.</p><br>
        <p>Fostering socially and environmentally responsible practices, attitudes and methodologies, most of
        his projects thus far have been material-object-technology oriented meditations on the
        quirks that make up the human condition.</p>
