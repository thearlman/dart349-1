    <h2>Square is a bizarre behance archive that kind of gives you a headache.</h2>

    <p>To be completely honest, I'm not sure if I like this website, or hate it. Frankly,
      it doesn't give you enough breathing room to be able to decide, but that is a feat
      worth acknowledging all the same. From the moment you enter the website, the barrage
      of light sound and movement is unrelenting. </p>
    <p>Essentially, you are in a landscape made from sparsely arranged floating thumbnails
      of designers work. The word "SQUARE" floats in gigantic point size in the middle of
      the screen, and tips nauseatingly too and fro and you move the cursor around
      attempting to navigate. when your cursor approaches the edge of the window, the
      landscape moves accordingly. Every motion, click, scroll, sets into effect some
      new sequence of movement, colour, and sound. There is loud electro-pop playing the
      whole time. Though I spent probably 20 minutes "exploring" square, I'm still not
      totally sure what I've seen. bizarre </p>
