    <h1>HelloMe.studio</h1>
    <h2>HelloMe is a Berlin based design and advertising firm.</h2>

    <p>After a slight leaning curve, the navigation system the website
      uses is straightforward effective, and minimal, acting as both a
      static navigation bar, while also dynamically changing to reveal
      information as you hover over other elements. This is a good metaphor
      for the general theme of the site; making use of mostly static elements,
      but creating a dynamic experience.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the best example of this (at the time of writing) is the image
      of what appears to be a crumpled receipt on the home page. When clicked,
      you are redirected to another page which shows the receipt opened up, revealing
      that it is in fact a promotional scarf for sale by the studio. The site beautifully
      makes use of simple elements and typography, while combining them in a way which
      gives the overall experience a dynamic, luxurious feel.</p>
